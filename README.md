# Phaser3 Bitmap Font Generator

This is a small utility to create bitmap fonts for Phaser3 and others. There are existing tools to help with this process, however, they no longer appear to be supported / require an application or are not oss. Created with Phaser3.

Note: This is still in progress but works for general cases. XML is logged to the console and the PNG can be saved from the canvas context menu.
